        <p>Older adults are at a higher risk for falling for phishing scams due to a decline in the ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent links, and specific cognitive factors like lower memory capacity or reduced brain activity in regions that process body signals. Additionally, social isolation, a greater tendency to trust, and being a perceived prime target for their financial resources also increase their vulnerability. Scammers often exploit emotions, social isolation, and a lack of digital literacy to trick older adults into revealing personal information.</p>
